# 📜️**Portfolio Admin Version (Developer Mode)** 

This is the internal (admin/developer) version of my personal portfolio app. It allows me to listen to changes in Firebase, edit data in real-time, and push updates directly to the user-facing version.

## 🔧 Features

- Developed using Jetpack Compose and Kotlin
- Uses **Firebase** (Firestore, Realtime DB, Analytics).
- Based on **Clean Architecture** and **MVVM**.
- Uses **Hilt** for dependency injection.
- Handles async tasks with **Coroutines**.
- Manages state using **ViewModel**.
- Handles screen flow via **Compose Navigation**.
- Parses JSON with **Kotlinx Serialization**.
- Includes **Material icons** and components.


The portfolio is fully editable to allow for future updates as I continue to grow and gain experience in the field. It serves as a structured and interactive way to showcase my profile, technical journey, and achievements in mobile development.
